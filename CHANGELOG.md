# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Adapter wrapper packages — `hacker-bob-cc` (Claude Code) and `hacker-bob-codex`

- `hacker-bob-cc` is now an explicit Claude Code adapter wrapper: its bin is `hacker-bob-cc`, and it injects `--adapter claude` as the default before delegating to the canonical `hacker-bob` CLI. Explicit `--adapter <id>` is preserved so the wrapper does not block multi-adapter installs.
- New parallel package `hacker-bob-codex`: `npx hacker-bob-codex install <project-dir>` installs the Codex adapter without needing `--adapter codex`.
- The canonical `hacker-bob` package and its `hacker-bob` binary are unchanged. Both wrappers depend on the canonical `hacker-bob@<version>`; framework updates ship from the canonical package and the wrapper deps bump in lock-step.
- Bin rename: the previous `hacker-bob-cc` package exposed a `hacker-bob` binary (collided with canonical when globally installed). It now exposes `hacker-bob-cc`. Use `npx hacker-bob-cc install <dir>` or `npx hacker-bob-codex install <dir>`.
- `scripts/release-check.js` now drives both wrappers from a `WRAPPER_PACKAGES` registry — adding a third wrapper means appending one entry. Each wrapper's bin source is grepped for the adapter literal so a future maintainer who renames the wrapper without updating its adapter pin gets a release-check failure.
- Tests added: per-wrapper version sync, package shape (bin name matches package name, files list contains only the bin, `dependencies.hacker-bob` pinned), bin script content (pushes `--adapter <id>`, respects explicit `--adapter`, delegates via `require`), and npm-pack output stays under 3 KB.

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase F: registry-driven role specs + bounty_read_surface_routes

- Added `HUNTER_ROLES` to `mcp/lib/capability-packs.js` as the single source of truth for hunter role display: role_id, name, description, color, role_bundles, prompt body filename. Multiple capability packs that share a role_id (e.g. Move-family aptos+sui) collapse to a single hunter role through the registry.
- `mcp/lib/role-model.js` now generates per-chain hunter role definitions from `HUNTER_ROLES` at module load. `scripts/lib/claude-role-renderer.js` and `adapters/codex/role-specs.js` derive their hunter entries the same way. `mcp/lib/tool-registry.js` derives the chain-specific entries of `VALID_ROLE_BUNDLES` from `HUNTER_ROLES`. Adding a 7th hunter role auto-extends every consumer; no parallel hand-coded entries left to drift.
- New `scripts/lib/codex-role-renderer.js` constant `CODEX_CROSS_CUTTING_ROLE_IDS` makes the cross-cutting Codex worker contracts explicit; per-chain role ids are appended from `HUNTER_ROLES`. The chain-specific spawn template body for the generic SPAWN_HUNTER_AGENT codex template now derives the hunter-X-agent name list from the registry instead of inlining it.
- New MCP tool `bounty_read_surface_routes` (read-only) exposed to orchestrator/verifier/chain/evidence/reporter role bundles. Returns the per-surface routing payload (`capability_pack`, `hunter_agent`, `brief_profile`, `confidence`, `reasons`) the surface-router writes to `surface-routes.json`. Surface-router-agent itself does not need it (writes once and exits). Orchestrator prompt updated to call it after the routing wave completes; verifier/chain/evidence/reporter dispatch on persisted `finding.capability_pack` (Phase C) so this tool is forward-looking primitive + operator visibility.
- Brutalist roast (Codex critic) caught two real bugs and addressed them in this commit:
  - **`waves.js` `BLOCKED_HARNESS_KIND_VALUES` was a separate enum from the schema.** Phase E extended the JSON schema in `bounty_write_wave_handoff` to accept anchor_fork/aptos_fork/sui_fork/substrate_fork/cosmwasm_fork, but the runtime normalizer in `waves.js` had its own enum that was never updated. Hunters following the Phase E catalogue would have failed finalization at the runtime check before even reaching schema validation. Three-way mirror: renderer constant `BLOCKED_HARNESS_RUN_KINDS`, schema enum, and runtime `BLOCKED_HARNESS_KIND_VALUES` now all in lock-step; new test verifies parity.
  - **Codex renderer leaked chain identifiers.** `CODEX_WORKER_CONTRACT_ROLE_IDS` was a hand-coded list including hunter-evm/hunter-svm/etc. Phase F derives it from `HUNTER_ROLES` so Codex picks up new hunter roles automatically. The generic SPAWN_HUNTER_AGENT codex template body also inlined every chain agent name; now derived from the registry.
- New gate tests:
  - `Phase F: adding a chain pack costs the documented number of files (registry consolidation gate)` — scans `role-model.js`, `tool-registry.js`, `claude-role-renderer.js`, `codex-role-renderer.js`, and `codex/role-specs.js` for any chain-specific bundle identifier (hunter-evm, hunter-svm, hunter-move, hunter-substrate, hunter-cosmwasm). Forces consolidation; future maintainer adding a chain coupling outside the registry has to either fix the abstraction or extend the gate's known-allowed list.
  - `Phase F: HUNTER_ROLES is the single source of truth for hunter role specs across consumers` — asserts every `HUNTER_ROLES` entry surfaces in each consumer with matching name/color/description/role_bundles. Catches drift before runtime.
  - `Phase E/F: BLOCKED_HARNESS_RUN_KINDS, schema enum, and waves.js normalizer all stay in sync` — three-way mirror test described above.
- Brutalist findings explicitly deferred (Phase F documented as "registry-driven where it matters, irreducible where it doesn't"):
  - `mcp/lib/constants.js` chain enum lists, `mcp/lib/findings.js` per-chain validation branches (chain_id + address encoding), `mcp/lib/hunter-brief.js` per-chain harness path scalars, `mcp/lib/evm-rpc-pool.js` RPC dispatch — all genuinely per-chain. Adding a 7th chain still requires editing these, but each edit is a 1-2 line addition and the abstraction makes the cost predictable.
  - `startWave()` reroutes the entire attack surface on every wave; one malformed unrelated SC surface can DoS a wave assignment. Pre-existing; out of scope for the registry refactor.
- Test totals: 493 across 9 suites (was 491; +2 net Phase F: HUNTER_ROLES drift gate + 7-pack-cost gate; existing schema-vs-renderer mirror extended to three-way). Release-check 0 warnings.
- Cost of adding a 7th chain pack today: **~5 files** — `mcp/lib/capability-packs.js` (HUNTER_ROLES + CAPABILITY_PACKS + chain_family map), `mcp/lib/findings.js` (chain_id + address validation), `mcp/lib/constants.js` (chain enum if needed), `prompts/roles/chain.md` (pivot patterns), `prompts/roles/hunter-NEW_CHAIN.md` (new file). RPC pool depends on whether the chain reuses an existing module. Phase F got us from 11–12 changes to 5; the rest is genuinely irreducible content per chain.

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase E: pack-keyed hunter spawn catalogue

- Each capability pack now declares a `spawn` block with renderer-agnostic fields (`profile`, `chain_family`, `hunter_name_prefix`, `chain_id_description`, `workflow_summary`, `cli_dependency`, `blocked_harness_kind_options`). Web pack carries only `profile: "web"` because its prompt fields differ structurally from on-chain hunters and stay on the legacy SPAWN_HUNTER_AGENT body. Adding a 7th SC pack auto-extends every consumer: spawn template, dispatch catalogue, anti-cruft tests, and renderer parity.
- `mcp/lib/capability-packs-rendering.js` exposes `substituteClaudeHunterPackCatalogue` and `substituteCodexHunterPackCatalogue`, both consuming a single `{{HUNTER_PACK_CATALOGUE}}` placeholder. The renderer emits one canonical SC spawn template plus a one-line-per-pack catalogue keyed by `capability_pack` (the field every downstream consumer dispatches on); chain_family is shown alongside as an aid, not as the lookup key.
- Removed five inline SPAWN_HUNTER_*_AGENT template literals from each renderer (~80 lines of per-chain workflow strings on Claude, ~30 on Codex). `prompts/roles/orchestrator.md` lost six chain-specific spawn placeholders plus the inline catalogue prose; both collapsed into one `{{HUNTER_PACK_CATALOGUE}}` line.
- Brutalist roast (Codex critic) found and addressed five real hazards in the same commit:
  - **Schema mismatch on `blocked_harness_runs[].kind`.** Pre-existing but Phase E surfaced it: the `bounty_write_wave_handoff` schema only accepted `foundry_fork`/`rpc_endpoint`/etc., yet every SC runner self-reports `anchor_fork`/`aptos_fork`/`sui_fork`/`substrate_fork`/`cosmwasm_fork` and the original SPAWN_HUNTER_*_AGENT templates told hunters to write those values. SC waves that hit a fork-blocked path would have failed finalization. Schema enum now includes all six chain kinds; new test asserts the renderer constant `BLOCKED_HARNESS_RUN_KINDS` mirrors the schema enum exactly.
  - **Codex catalogue double-printed "Codex worker".** `workerLabel(roleId)` returns `${bob_role} -> Codex worker`, so prefixing with "Codex worker " produced "Codex worker hunter-evm-agent -> Codex worker, capability_pack ...". Catalogue now uses `${codexWorkerLabelFor(pack)}` directly. Also added a fail-loud check in `codexWorkerLabelForPack` so a future pack without a matching codex role spec throws at render time instead of silently emitting "undefined -> Codex undefined".
  - **Wrong lookup key in catalogue.** `bounty_start_wave` returns `capability_pack` and `hunter_agent` on each assignment, never `chain_family`. Catalogue lines now lead with `capability_pack: "smart_contract_evm"` (the value the orchestrator actually receives) with chain_family in parens for context.
  - **Two overlapping spawn templates without a clear switch.** The generic web template and the SC canonical template both used `[assignment.hunter_agent]`; a literal orchestrator could double-spawn for one assignment. Catalogue preamble now spells out the dispatch: `brief_profile === "web"` → generic; otherwise → SC canonical with catalogue lookup.
  - **Canonical template referenced fields not on the assignment.** Old text said `[assignment.hunter_agent prefix]` and `[pack.spawn.workflow_summary]` — neither exists in the assignment object. Template now uses `[assignment.hunter_agent]` directly for the spawn name and instructs the operator to copy workflow / CLI / blocked-kind verbatim from the catalogue line.
- Scope-deferred (Phase F): full single-file invariant for adding a 7th pack still requires edits in `mcp/lib/constants.js`, `mcp/lib/role-model.js`, `mcp/lib/tool-registry.js`, `mcp/lib/evm-rpc-pool.js`, `scripts/lib/claude-role-renderer.js`, and `adapters/codex/role-specs.js`. Phase E achieves the spawn-template invariant only. `startWave()` reroutes every surface during a single wave (potential operability DoS if any unrelated low-priority surface is malformed); fix is part of broader router/spec hygiene.
- Tests added (+3): every SC pack ships a complete spawn block with kinds in the schema enum; rendered orchestrator catalogue lists every SC pack exactly once; renderer source files contain zero per-chain workflow strings (the only source is `pack.spawn`). Renamed three Phase 5/6 dispatch tests to be pack-driven assertions instead of pinning placeholders. New schema-vs-renderer mirror test catches future enum divergence.
- Test totals: 491 across 9 suites (was 490; +4 net for Phase E once mirror+catalogue+anti-cruft tests landed; -3 from old placeholder-pinning tests rewritten in place). Release-check 0 warnings.

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase D: pack-keyed verifier and evidence dispatch

- Each capability pack now declares `verifier` and `evidence` blocks. Verifier blocks carry `replay_tool`, `sample_type`, `fresh_state_omit_field` (the runner-input parameter to omit for fresh-state replay), `block_reference_field` + `block_reference_label` (the runner response field with the resolved block reference), and an optional `disambiguation` { `tool`, `fail_reason` } for chains where same-shaped addresses can mislead the runner.
- Split `smart_contract_move` into `smart_contract_aptos` and `smart_contract_sui`. Both still spawn `hunter-move-agent` (the agent's tool list covers both `bounty_aptos_*` and `bounty_sui_*`), but verifier dispatch is now exactly one runner per pack.
- New shared module `mcp/lib/capability-packs-rendering.js` (used by both Claude and Codex renderers) exposes `renderCapabilityPackVerifierTable` and `substituteCapabilityPackVerifierTable`. Brutalist/balanced/final/evidence prompt sources embed the `{{CAPABILITY_PACK_VERIFIER_TABLE}}` placeholder; both renderers expand it to the per-pack reference table at render time. Adding a 7th SC pack updates every consumer prompt automatically.
- Verifier prompt sources shrunk dramatically (~22% total): `chain_family` references in source went from {brutalist 12, balanced 2, final 2, evidence 1} to ≤1 each; `brutalist-verifier.md` lost 79 lines of per-chain branching prose.
- Brutalist roast (claude + codex critics) surfaced two real bugs and several smaller alignments, all fixed in this commit:
  - **Critical: Codex agents shipped with raw `{{CAPABILITY_PACK_VERIFIER_TABLE}}` placeholders.** The substitution was implemented only in the Claude renderer; Codex worker contracts in `bob-hunt/SKILL.md` told workers to consult a table that was never rendered. Fixed by extracting substitution into the shared `capability-packs-rendering` module and wiring it into both renderer code paths plus the Codex role-contract appendix.
  - **Critical: `fresh_state_omit_field` was ambiguous between sc_evidence schema and runner input names.** sc_evidence persists a single `fork_block` field for every chain (findings.js); the runner accepts chain-specific input parameter names (`fork_slot` for SVM, `fork_version` for Aptos, `fork_checkpoint` for Sui). Manifest now documents these as runner-input parameter names; verifier prompts clarify the translation from sc_evidence → runner input.
  - Web pack now also has `verifier` + `evidence` blocks (replay via `bounty_http_scan`, sample_type `http_replay`) so the table is uniform — though the verifier prompt still carries Web auth-flow prose since auth profile lookup isn't expressible in a single column today.
  - Codex renderer was also missing the chain-specific spawn templates (`{{SPAWN_HUNTER_EVM_AGENT}}` etc.) and the evidence agent template, leaking them as raw placeholders. Added all six.
- Tests rewritten (Phase D): 9 prompt-contract tests that previously asserted "verifier source body contains `bounty_X_run`" were rewritten to assert (a) source instructs pack-driven dispatch via `finding.capability_pack` and embeds the placeholder, (b) the pack registry is the source of truth for replay/disambiguation/sample-type, (c) the rendered `.claude/agents/X.md` contains every runner via the rendered table. New tests added: chain_family ≤2 budget per verifier source (anti-cruft), verifier replay tool registry resolution for every pack, evidence runner registry resolution, `no rendered prompt artifact leaks an unsubstituted {{...}} placeholder` (catches future renderer-parity drift across all generated artifacts).
- Test totals: 487 across 9 suites (was 469; +18 net for Phase D once parity tests added). Release-check 0 warnings.

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase C: persist routing on findings

- `bounty_record_finding` now persists `capability_pack`, `hunter_agent`, and `brief_profile` onto every finding, derived from the assigned wave's route metadata. Findings.jsonl rows carry the routed pack triple so verifier/grader/reporter can dispatch on it directly in Phase D instead of re-deriving from `surface_type` + `sc_evidence.chain_family`.
- `findings.md` mirror gained a `Capability Pack:` line so triage shows the routed pack and hunter agent alongside surface and auth profile.
- Read-side backfill: `normalizeFindingRecord` reconstructs the pack triple from `surface_type` + `sc_evidence.chain_family` for any pre-Phase-C row that lacks the metadata. Added `capabilityPackForLegacyFinding` to `mcp/lib/capability-packs.js` for that path. Phase D consumers never see null — the read shim removes the fallback chain everyone would otherwise have to re-implement.
- Brutalist roast fed back four real hazards, all fixed in this commit:
  - **All-null shortcut on assignment route metadata silently produced web defaults.** A smart-contract assignment with the route triple dropped (forged file, half-rolled-back upgrade) was rubber-stamped as a web hunter. `normalizeAssignmentRouteMetadata` now throws when `surface_type === "smart_contract"` and the triple is absent.
  - **Surface router fell back to the web pack for `smart_contract` surfaces with missing/unsupported `chain_family`.** That produced `surface_type=smart_contract` + `capability_pack=web` in the routes file — two truths fighting. `classifySurfaceCapability` now throws so the operator either fixes the surface or registers the missing pack.
  - **No-wave path hardcoded the web pack triple.** Correctness depended on a non-local invariant (the `sc_evidence`-on-non-SC reject in the normalizer). Added a local assert: `recordFinding` rejects `sc_evidence` when wave/agent are absent.
  - **Legacy null reads recreated the dispatch fallback Phase C is meant to remove.** Read-side backfill eliminates that.
- Test infrastructure: `seedAssignments` now mirrors production by classifying each surface through `classifySurfaceCapability` to derive route metadata, so SC test setups get the correct pack triple instead of the dangerous all-null state.
- Tests added (+9, 321 mcp-server total): web round-trip with web pack, EVM round-trip with `smart_contract_evm` pack, Substrate round-trip, legacy web row backfill, legacy SC row backfill (EVM + SVM), no-wave SC reject, classifier-throws-on-missing/unsupported chain_family, normalizer-throws-on-SC-assignment-without-triple, findings.md mirror exposes the routed pack.

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase B: profile-shaped hunter briefs

- `bounty_read_hunter_brief` now dispatches by `routeMetadata.brief_profile` to one of two builders. Web profile carries HTTP-flavored intel (`bypass_table`, `techniques`, `payload_hints`, `knowledge_summary`, `traffic_summary`, `audit_summary`, `circuit_breaker_summary`, `intel_hints`, `static_scan_hints`, `auth_profiles_hint`). Smart-contract profiles carry on-chain context (`bob_spec_status` filtered to the assigned surface, `rpc_pool` for the surface's `chain_family`/`chain_id`). Cross-cutting fields stay in both.
- Per-chain harness path scalars (`anchor_harness_path`, `move_harness_path`, `ink_harness_path`, `cargo_harness_path`, `cosmwasm_harness_path`) are now whitelisted in the slim-surface scalar limits. Previously only `foundry_harness_path` was preserved, which meant SVM/Move/Substrate/CosmWasm hunters' assigned harness paths were silently stripped — hunters then incorrectly recorded `blocked_harness_runs` and wrote partial handoffs.
- `rankAttackSurfaces` (which reads traffic and public-intel files to compute web-only summaries) is now skipped for non-web profiles. SC briefs no longer pay that I/O cost.
- Profile dispatch fails loudly on an unknown profile rather than falling open into the smart-contract path, so adding a non-web/non-SC pack requires an explicit dispatch-table entry.
- Updated the `bounty_read_hunter_brief` tool description and the orchestrator prompt to reflect the per-profile shape.
- Brutalist roast fed back: rejected per-chain SC builders today (YAGNI — all 5 SC packs converge on `bob_spec_status + rpc_pool`); kept `coverage_summary` in both profiles (write path is profile-agnostic, future wave merge depends on it); kept pretty-printed JSON output (transport already serializes compact when sending).
- Tests added: web brief shape (positive presence of all web-flavored fields), SC brief shape (positive presence of `bob_spec_status` typed payload + `rpc_pool` typed payload, omission of all 10 web-flavored fields), per-chain harness-path round-trip (5 chain cases × scalar field), and profile-dispatch fail-loud (forging an unknown profile on disk throws). Measured byte size: web 8081B, EVM 2940B (64% reduction).

### Capability-pack tightening — Phase A: per-pack tool bundles

- Removed the legacy `hunter` MCP role bundle. Bundle membership is now per-chain: `hunter-shared` (cross-cutting state-machine tools used by every hunter), `hunter-web`, `hunter-evm`, `hunter-svm`, `hunter-move`, `hunter-substrate`, `hunter-cosmwasm`.
- Each capability pack and each hunter role now declares `[hunter-shared, hunter-<chain>]`. SC hunter agent tool counts dropped from 38 → 10–13. Web hunter stays at 14.
- `bounty_record_surface_leads` and `bounty_read_surface_leads` moved from `hunter-shared` to `hunter-web` because the deep-mode lead-promotion flow is web-recon only; SC hunter prompts never invoked them. Brutalist roast surfaced this as silent allowlist cruft.
- Refreshed checked-in `.claude/settings.json` so `SubagentStop` matchers cover all six hunter agents (was stale at `hunter-agent` only). Direct-from-repo Claude usage now fires the stop hook for SC hunters.
- Added two new prompt-contract tests:
  - **pack ↔ role bundle consistency**: each `CAPABILITY_PACKS[pack].role_bundles` must equal the routed Claude role's `mcp_role_bundles`. Catches drift between `capability-packs.js` and `role-model.js` at test time, before silent misrouting at runtime.
  - **hunter MCP-tool budget**: each routed hunter agent must stay ≤16 MCP tools. Forces a code review conversation before a maintainer adds a tool to `hunter-shared` that re-creates the pre-Phase-A monolith.
- Known scope-deferred follow-ups (filed against later phases of the capability-pack roadmap, not blockers): `verifier` and `evidence` role bundles still carry all 21 SC tools as polymorphic dispatchers (Phase D); the generic `SPAWN_HUNTER_AGENT` template still embeds web-flavored instructions even when used for SC hunters (Phase E); `recon-agent` and `deep-recon-agent` do not yet emit `chain_family` so SC surface routing today depends on operator-supplied or spec-seeded surfaces.

### Capability-pack routing (merged from main)

- Added `mcp/lib/capability-packs.js` with a `web` pack and five smart-contract packs (`smart_contract_evm`, `smart_contract_svm`, `smart_contract_move`, `smart_contract_substrate`, `smart_contract_cosmwasm`). Each pack pins a `hunter_agent`, `brief_profile`, and role bundle; SC packs route by `surface.chain_family` (Aptos and Sui both go to `hunter-move-agent`).
- Added `bounty_route_surfaces` MCP tool plus `mcp/lib/surface-router.js` and a new `surface-router-agent` (rendered for both Claude and Codex). The orchestrator now spawns the router after recon and only transitions RECON → AUTH after `surface-routes.json` is written.
- `bounty_start_wave` now writes `capability_pack`, `hunter_agent`, and `brief_profile` into each persisted assignment and returns them in `result.data.assignments[]`. Hunters are spawned with `subagent_type: assignment.hunter_agent`; the orchestrator no longer branches by `chain_family` itself.
- Web tools moved to a new `hunter-web` role bundle so the `hunter-agent` agent receives a web-only allowlist; SC tools stay in `hunter` and SC hunter agents (`hunter-evm-agent`, etc.) keep their full chain tooling.
- `SubagentStop` hooks are now derived from `hunterAgentNamesForCapabilityPacks()` so each registered hunter family gets its own stop hook automatically; adding a pack adds a hook.
- `bounty_read_hunter_brief` now omits `bob_spec_status` and `rpc_pool` for web profiles and includes `run_context.capability_pack` / `hunter_agent` / `brief_profile` so hunters can confirm their routing.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-02

### Deep recon mode (merged from main)

- Added a `--deep` flag to `/bob-hunt` and `$bob-hunt` that swaps the normal recon agent for a new `deep-recon-agent` running broader passive discovery (subfinder, amass, assetfinder, chaos, crt.sh, archived URL collection, JS endpoint extraction, takeover candidates).
- Added compact `surface-leads.json` with three new MCP tools — `bounty_record_surface_leads`, `bounty_read_surface_leads`, `bounty_promote_surface_leads` — so hunters can log durable leads in deep mode and the orchestrator can promote ranked leads back into `attack_surface.json` for new waves.
- `state.deep_mode` persists on resume, so `/bob-hunt resume` keeps deep behavior even when `--deep` is omitted.

### Session summary, read guard, operator notes (merged from main)

- Added `bounty_read_session_summary` MCP tool returning a compact, structured summary (phase, blockers, evidence status, next action) so orchestrator/status/debug avoid bulky raw `state.json` reads.
- Added `.claude/hooks/session-read-guard.sh` PreToolUse hook that blocks Bash/Read against denylisted session artifacts (`state.json`, `findings.jsonl`, `report.md`, etc.) under `~/bounty-agent-sessions/`. Only `attack_surface.json` is allowed for direct reads.
- Added `mcp/lib/sensitive-material.js` validation that rejects auth headers, cookies, JWTs, and other secrets at the input boundary of any mutating MCP tool.
- Added `bounty_set_operator_note` and `bounty_clear_operator_note` for bounded non-secret operator instructions stored in session state.
- Verifier/grader/reporter/evidence prompts now require compact summary-only final responses with `BOB_VERIFY_DONE` / `BOB_CHAIN_DONE` / `BOB_GRADE_DONE` / `BOB_REPORT_DONE` / `BOB_EVIDENCE_DONE` markers and explicit forbids on raw requests, responses, cookies, tokens, or authorization headers in the final message.

### Offline guide and architecture site (merged from main)

- Added `docs/hacker-bob-offline-guide.md` (operator manual) and `docs/hacker-bob-offline-guide.pdf` (printable form).
- Added `docs/bob-architecture-event.html` (single-page architecture overview) and `docs/hacker-bob-github-qr.png`.
- Added `site/` (React + Vite marketing site source).

### Smart-contract testing pipeline (Phase 0–6)

- Added six chain-family runners with allowlisted, sandboxed test execution: `bounty_foundry_run` and `bounty_halmos_run` (EVM), `bounty_anchor_run` (SVM), `bounty_aptos_run` and `bounty_sui_run` (Move), `bounty_substrate_run` (ink! / `cargo test`), and `bounty_cosmwasm_run` (cw-multi-test / `cargo test`). Each runner accepts a manifest path and a single test selector, parses framework output into structured pass/fail records, and caps captured stdout to bounded excerpts.
- Added 14 read-only chain-data fetch tools across the same six families for live state lookups during HUNT/CHAIN/VERIFY.
- Added new `hunter-substrate` and `hunter-cosmwasm` agent roles with bug-class catalogs (e.g., `set_code_hash_unauthorized`, `caller_spoof`, `lazy_storage_layout_drift`, `chain_extension_unauthenticated`, `migrate_msg_open`, `submessage_reply_misuse`, `indexed_map_key_collision`).
- Extended findings normalization to validate SS58 (substrate) and bech32 (cosmwasm) addresses with their actual checksum/length rules; rejected EVM-shape addresses on Move families.
- Added a dedicated `evidence-agent` role that dispatches by `surface_type`: HTTP findings go through `bounty_http_scan`; SC findings go through the appropriate family runner with a `sample_type` mapping (`evm_foundry_run`, `svm_anchor_run`, `aptos_move_test`, `sui_move_test`, `substrate_ink_test`, `cosmwasm_cw_multi_test`).
- Phase gates now treat SC surfaces consistently: HUNT→CHAIN respects `partial` + `bypass_attempts`; CHAIN→VERIFY clears via `bounty_write_chain_attempt` per pivot; VERIFY→GRADE clears via SC-aware evidence packs.

### Adapter auto-detection on install / update / doctor / uninstall

- `hacker-bob install <project-dir>` no longer requires `--adapter`. When the flag is omitted, Bob picks an adapter using a layered detector: (1) prior install metadata in `.hacker-bob/install.json`, (2) host environment markers (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, `$CODEX_HOME`), (3) project files (`.claude/`, `.codex/plugins/`, `.agents/plugins/`, `.mcp.json`), or (4) host CLI on `PATH`. Claude remains the final fallback. The chosen adapter and reason are logged to stderr.
- **Behavior change (no-flag `install` and `update`):** previously, missing `--adapter` always defaulted to `claude`. Reinstalling a Codex-only project would silently install Claude *alongside* it; updating that project would refresh only Claude. With auto-detection, reinstalls and updates preserve the existing adapter mix from `.hacker-bob/install.json`.
- **Behavior change (no-flag `doctor`):** previously, missing `--adapter` ran only Claude checks. Now `doctor` runs the checks for every adapter recorded in install metadata.
- **Behavior change (no-flag `uninstall`):** previously, missing `--adapter` removed only Claude. Now `uninstall` removes every adapter recorded in install metadata. The default `--dry-run` behavior is unchanged: explicit `--yes` is still required to remove files.
- Added `detectAdapterId(projectDir, options)` to `adapters/index.js` as a pure, host-injectable function with a fixed precedence order; added `resolveInstallAdapters` and `resolveLifecycleAdapters` helpers in `scripts/install.js` and `scripts/lifecycle.js` so install/update/doctor/uninstall share the same adapter resolution path.

### Brutalist verifier wired to `@brutalist/mcp`

- Added the external `@brutalist/mcp` server (npm) to the install configuration of every adapter as an optional MCP server alongside `bountyagent`. Claude registers it via `.mcp.json` merge; Codex ships it in the bundled plugin `.mcp.json`; generic-mcp merges it into the operator's root `.mcp.json`.
- Updated `prompts/roles/brutalist-verifier.md` so the brutalist verifier calls `mcp__brutalist__roast` per finding for an additional adversarial pass after the PoC re-run, with explicit graceful fallback when the MCP is unavailable. The roast verdict folds into `reasoning`; the PoC re-run still drives `disposition` and `severity`.
- The brutalist tools allowlist excludes `mcp__brutalist__roast_cli_debate` — the debate orchestrator is too time-expensive for a per-finding loop. Only `roast`, `brutalist_discover`, and `cli_agent_roster` are exposed.
- `requiredMcpServers` for brutalist-verifier remains `bountyagent`-only so the agent can spawn even when `@brutalist/mcp` is absent.
- Added an info-level doctor check (`claude_mcp_brutalist_optional`, `generic_mcp_brutalist_optional`) reporting brutalist-server presence; never errors on absence.

### AI-agent install reframing (mirrors main v1.1.8 / v1.1.9 intents, adapted for the multi-adapter architecture)

- Added a new `### For AI Coding Agents` subsection at the top of the README Quickstart that treats a pasted repository URL as an install request, defaults the install target to `$PWD`, and tells AI agents not to ask "what do you want to do?" when the current directory is a normal project.
- Documented the auto-detection precedence and the per-adapter verification commands (claude: `claude mcp list` shows `bountyagent`; codex: `~/.codex/skills/bob-hunt/SKILL.md` exists; generic-mcp: `.mcp.json` contains `mcpServers.bountyagent`).
- Added a "do not install into the Hacker Bob source tree" guard for AI agents.
- Added a `## MCP Troubleshooting` section covering the `Cannot find module './tools/index.js'` failure mode and three adapter-specific reload failures, plus a callout that `bountyagent` is the expected MCP server namespace and not a stale skill name.
- Tagline edit: "point him at a domain" → "point him at an authorized target".
- Ignored `.claude/bob/{VERSION,install.json,egress-profiles.json}` so installing Bob into a hacker-bob source checkout does not leak machine-specific install metadata into commits.

### Tests

- Added `test/adapter-detection.test.js` with 14 unit tests covering all four detection layers and precedence.
- Added 7 new CLI integration tests covering: fresh-install default fallback, project-artifact-driven codex selection, reinstall preservation, multi-adapter no-flag uninstall, multi-adapter no-flag doctor, no-flag update preserving prior adapters, and generic-mcp `.mcp.json` presence after install.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-04-29

- Simplified README onboarding for AI coding agents: a pasted repository URL is now explicitly treated as an install request.
- Changed the AI-agent default path to install into the current working directory with `npx -y hacker-bob-cc@latest install "$PWD"`, then run the MCP load check and `claude mcp list`.
- Added guidance that agents should not ask "what do you want to do?" when the current directory is a normal project/workspace.
- Kept source-clone installation as a fallback for npm outages or explicit source-install requests.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-04-29

- Reordered the README quickstart so AI coding agents see the repository-link install flow before the human install path.
- Clarified that the cloned Hacker Bob repository is normally the install source and that Bob must be installed into the Claude Code project where `/bob-hunt` will run.
- Documented that `bountyagent` is the expected internal MCP server namespace behind Bob's `bounty_*` tools, while `/bob-*` commands remain the user-facing surface.
- Added MCP troubleshooting for stale or incomplete installs that fail with `Cannot find module './tools/index.js'`.
- Ignored local `.claude/bob/` install metadata so source checkouts used for packaging do not accidentally include machine-specific install state.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-04-28

- Added operator-controlled egress profiles under `.claude/bob/`, including a safe example config, installer-preserved operator config, and `/bob-egress` management commands for listing, adding, testing, enabling, disabling, and removing profiles.
- Extended `bounty_http_scan` with optional `egress_profile` support, proxy-backed `http`, `https`, `socks5`, and `socks5h` scanning through `proxy-agent`, early profile validation, credential redaction, and audit fields for `egress_profile` and `egress_region`.
- Added geofence/reachability visibility for repeated first-party network failures through HTTP audit summaries, circuit-breaker summaries, pipeline analytics, `/bob-status`, `/bob-debug --deep`, and hunter briefs.
- Updated `/bob-hunt` so `--egress <profile>` is passed through AUTH, hunter, chain, verifier, and evidence prompts while keeping profile switching explicit and operator-controlled.
- Updated install, doctor, uninstall, packaging, and release checks so the egress command, helper, config example, runtime dependency, and package metadata are shipped and validated.
- Changed `/bob-hunt` so zero-reportable VERIFY results still close through SKIP grading and a no-findings report instead of stopping at VERIFY.
- Added hunter guardrails for repeated `INTERNAL_ERROR` host failures and explicit `chain_notes` length truncation before wave handoff writes.
- Added required force-merge reasons to wave reconciliation and pipeline analytics so debug attribution survives without transcript context.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-04-27

- Added bounded evidence pack visibility to `/bob-status` so operators can see whether final reportable findings have valid, missing/invalid, skipped, or unknown evidence readiness.
- Documented the `VERIFY -> GRADE` evidence-pack gate without adding a new FSM phase: final reportable findings need valid evidence packs after final verification and before grading or reporting.
- Tightened prompt-contract coverage so `/bob-status` may read evidence packs for confirmation while remaining read-only and non-networked.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-26

- Fixed `/bob-update` and the `bob-status` skill body so the `node .../.claude/hooks/bob-update.js` invocations resolve when Claude Code does not propagate `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` into the assistant's Bash tool subprocess (observed on Claude Code 2.1.119). Both surfaces now use `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}` so the path falls back to the Bash tool's working directory, which is the project root, while still preferring the env var when the harness exports it.
- Added prompt-contract regression assertions pinning the `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}` form in `bob-update.md` and `bob-status/SKILL.md` so a future edit cannot silently reintroduce the bare `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` that produced `MODULE_NOT_FOUND /.claude/hooks/bob-update.js`.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-04-27

- Fixed the installer to copy the shipped `testing/policy-replay/` harness into target projects so `/bob-debug` replay escalation can run from installed workspaces.
- Added doctor and install-smoke coverage for the policy replay harness files.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-27

- Added a shipped `testing/policy-replay/` harness for diagnosing Bob policy/refusal regressions with the Claude Agent SDK and local Claude OAuth.
- Updated `/bob-debug` so post-session QA can detect policy/refusal stuck signals, run bounded local replay/tune diagnostics, and suggest a reviewed prompt change without editing prompts or mutating session state.
- Added structured chain-attempt artifacts and read/write MCP tools so CHAIN, VERIFY, GRADE, REPORT, analytics, and hooks consume machine-readable chain evidence instead of markdown.
- Added CI-safe policy replay tests, package coverage for the replay harness, and release packaging of the harness scripts and sample fixture.
- Deprecated the older raw Anthropic API refusal replay helpers in favor of the maintained policy replay case format.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-26

- Renamed the three skill directories and frontmatter `name:` fields to hyphen form (`bob-hunt`, `bob-status`, `bob-debug`). v1.1.1 used colon-form `name:` (`bob:hunt`), which Claude Code v2.1.119 rejects as invalid (`name:` only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens), so it silently fell back to the directory name and registered the slashes as `/bountyagent`, `/bountyagentstatus`, `/bountyagentdebug` — meaning typing `/bob:hunt` got rewritten to `/bountyagent` on enter.
- Renamed `/bob:update` to `/bob-update` and moved the command from `.claude/commands/bob/update.md` to `.claude/commands/bob-update.md` so all four slash commands share the same hyphen scheme.
- Installer and `dev-sync.sh` now proactively delete the legacy `bountyagent`, `bountyagentstatus`, `bountyagentdebug` skill directories and the entire `commands/bob/` subdirectory on upgrade, so users coming from `<=1.1.1` do not keep orphan slash entries.
- Uninstall manifest sweeps the new layout, the v1.1.1 layout, and the v1.1.0 layout so old installs still clean up entirely.
- Updated README, CLAUDE.md, FIRST_RUN, ROADMAP, TROUBLESHOOTING, and media docs to use the new `/bob-hunt`, `/bob-status`, `/bob-debug`, `/bob-update` slashes.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-25

- Fixed duplicate slash entries (`/bob-hunt` + `/bob:hunt`, etc.) in the Claude Code menu by giving the three skills colon-form `name:` frontmatter (`bob:hunt`, `bob:status`, `bob:debug`) so each skill IS its own slash command.
- Removed redundant command shims `commands/bob/{hunt,status,debug}.md`; only `commands/bob/update.md` remains because no skill backs `/bob:update`.
- Installer and `dev-sync.sh` now proactively delete the legacy hunt/status/debug shims on upgrade so users coming from <=1.1.0 do not retain orphan files that would re-introduce the duplicates.
- Uninstall manifest sweeps both the current shim layout and the legacy three-shim layout so old installs still clean up entirely.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-26

- Added `hacker-bob doctor <project-dir> [--json]` for read-only install diagnostics.
- Added `hacker-bob uninstall <project-dir> [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]` for conservative removal of Bob-managed files and config entries.
- Added the `hacker-bob` npm alias package while keeping `hacker-bob-cc` canonical.
- Updated release publishing to publish both npm packages with provenance.
- Added Quickstart, troubleshooting docs, release notes, and bug report diagnostics guidance.
- Optimized the README image to reduce npm package size.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-26

- Clarified install docs and CLI help: Bob installs into one project directory per command, while global npm install only installs the `hacker-bob` CLI.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-26

- Initial public `hacker-bob-cc` npm package with `hacker-bob` CLI install and update commands.
- Added `/bob:update`, passive update cache checks, installed version metadata, and status update hints.
- Preserved the source `install.sh` path as a compatibility wrapper.
